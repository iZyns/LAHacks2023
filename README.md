# LAHacks2023

Elevator Pitch:
We want to make education available for everyone. With ED-YOU, YOU can meet and learn concepts with different people all around the world!

## Inspiration

The ED-YOU website is an online platform that aims to provide a global space for people to connect and study together. The platform consists of different chatrooms, each dedicated to specific courses or subjects, allowing individuals from all over the world to collaborate, share ideas, and learn from each other.

The primary objective of this project is to make education accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or socioeconomic status. By creating a virtual study environment that fosters cooperation and cross-cultural exchange, ED-YOU encourages diversity and inclusivity in education.

Users of the ED-YOU website can search for and join chatrooms related to their preferred courses or subjects. They can also create their own chatrooms and invite others to join. Within each chatroom, users can exchange messages, share files and resources, and collaborate on projects.

Overall, ED-YOU seeks to revolutionize the way people learn by harnessing the power of technology to connect individuals from different parts of the world and facilitate cross-cultural learning.

## What it does

In ED-YOU, students can create their own chatrooms to study together and meet new people all around the world.

## How we built it

We built this using MongoDB, ExpressJS, ReactJS, and NodeJS.

## Challenges we ran into

Designing the frontend was difficult as we had to query through the backend and database to get the information.

## What we learned

With most of us being first-timers at a hackathon, we learned how to work with React.JS and collaborate/communicate with our team members.

## What's next for ED-YOU

We intend on adding videos and deploying them to the internet outside of just running them locally on the computer.

Features to come:
- Choice channel
- List of subjects and topics
- Invite other users to a study space
- Resources tab
- Automatic deletion of a study space group when inactive for a period amount of time
